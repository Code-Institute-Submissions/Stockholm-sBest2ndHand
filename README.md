This webpage lists secondhand stores in Stockholm and employs HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. It also includes an

navigation bar, email, and map. EmailJS was also used for the email functionality and Font Awesome was used for icons. 
The project was completed in Gitpod and GitHub was used for version control.
