Stockholm's Best Secondhand

[![Gitpod Ready-to-Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Gitpod-Ready--to--Code-blue?logo=gitpod)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/PWashburn55/Milestone2) 

This webpage lists some good secondhand stores in Stockholm and features a map with lettered markers. The 
site is designed to make it easy for people who would like to find thrift stores and who would like to see where 
they are located in relationship to one another, to make it easier to plan a shopping trip. The stores listed 
below the map each have a letter next to the address corresponding to the letter on the marker on the map.

In addition, the stores have a link to their web page next to the store name to make it easier for people to
get more information. At the bottom of the page is an email form for people to suggest more stores or give other
feedback.

UX Design

The webpage was designed using responsive design principles so that it can be viewed on mobile or larger screens, with an
image that adjusts in size, a menu bar that collapses, and a list of stores that has either one or two stores per row, 
depending on the size of the screen.

The color scheme was selected based on UX design principles of having contrasting colors and a 60-30-10 balance of a neutral
color (white) with an accent color (peachy coral) and a third color (black). The layout was meant to be clean with plenty of negative space. It is on a single page because there was
 not a lot of information.

Features

The page has a navigation bar, an embedded Google map with lettered markers, store descriptions with links to the 
store web sites, and a contact form at the bottom. The image is from Pixabay and I wrote the descriptions. Future 
improvements to the webpage could include adding a functionality for users to add comments and/or ratings for the 
various stores. 


Technologies Used

The page was designed with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. EmailJS was used for the email functionality and the Google Maps 
API was used for the map with Info Windows. JavaScript was used for the email functionality, the map, and the navigation 
bar and menu. Code from other sources is noted in the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.


Testing

To test the webpage I clicked the links as well as the markers on the map. I also sent emails using the form on
the page to make sure it worked. In addition, I viewed the page on small and larger screens.
